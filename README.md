# 100
The first hundred days is often a good indicator of the success of a first-term president. [During FDR's presidency, in the first 100 days of 73rd Congress, he signed **76** bills into law. By comparison, Ronald Reagan took the most executive actions in modern history, revoking **18** executive orders while adding **18** of his own. ](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-presidents-first-100-days-really-do-matter/) Although many are still in denial of the historic upset of a Trump victory, his 100 days is well underway. And if he continues his unconventional record, this 100 days will be full of surprises.


## Project Prospectus:
### Key metrics
In this project, we will take a look at the first hundred days of POTUS 42, 43, 44, and 45, two republicans and two democrats. We will explore the following metrics:
* number of bills signed into law
* number of executive orders issued/revoked
* the composition of the House and Senate
* bills vetoed/veto overridden
* approval rate
* (impeachment?)
* (we can also explore other metrics, like the duration before the cabinet was confirmed, number of federal appointments made etc.)

### Sentiment Analysis
"Fake news?" "Shove the podium in your face?" We will take a look at the general sentiment during these 100 days and compare them against each other. [In reference to Pew Research Center's 2014 research,](http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/) we have selected Wall Street Journal and Washington Post (center right and center left respectively, pending availability of WSJ earlier articles) based on their audience's ideological placement. (tentatively using python and its NLP libraries)

### Visualization
In order to visualize our findings, we will construct a single-page website. (tentatively using React.js) Users will scroll through and follow the storyline. We will explore some data visualization tools to present graphs and charts when necessary, while using SVGs for majority of our graphics and animations.
